By providing detailed subsurface information, geophysics helps optimize drill programs, minimize land disturbance, and improve resource estimation accuracy.\\n\\nFrom airborne electromagnetics to 3D seismic imaging, our geophysics team is at the forefront of applying these technologies to support responsible resource development."
